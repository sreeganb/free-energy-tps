# TPS based free energy calculations 
 
The necessary python framework for running and analysing free energies using transition path sampling 
trajectories.

Requirements:
1) CHARMM to run QM/MM simulations
2) TPS ensemble corresponding to the reaction for which the free energy profile is to be calculated
3) Python libraries such as numpy, seaborn, etc.
